# Welcome to Quality Playbook

I'm excited to launch **Quality Playbook**, a space where I share insights, strategies, and lessons learned from my journey in quality engineering.

## What is Quality Playbook?

Quality Playbook is my personal blog where I document experiences, experiments, and best practices in:

- **Test Automation** - Building scalable, maintainable test frameworks
- **Quality Engineering** - Shifting quality left and embedding it into the development process
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automating quality gates and deployment workflows
- **Real-world Projects** - Case studies from building [missingtable.com](https://missingtable.com) and match-scraper

## Why I Created This Blog

Throughout my career in quality engineering, I've learned that quality isn't just about finding bugs - it's about building systems that prevent them. I created this blog to:

1. **Share Knowledge** - Document solutions to problems I've solved
2. **Build in Public** - Showcase my work and approach to quality
3. **Connect with Others** - Engage with the QE community

## What You Can Expect

I'll be writing about:

### Test Automation
```python
# Example: Simple pytest fixture for API testing
import pytest
import requests

@pytest.fixture
def api_client():
    """Fixture providing authenticated API client"""
    client = requests.Session()
    client.headers.update({
        'Authorization': 'Bearer test-token'
    })
    return client

def test_get_user(api_client):
    response = api_client.get('/api/users/1')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert 'email' in response.json()
```

### Quality Metrics
How to measure and improve quality across your systems - from code coverage to deployment frequency.

### Infrastructure as Code
Deploying quality systems using Kubernetes, Helm, and GitOps workflows.

## The Tech Stack

This blog itself is built with modern technologies:

- **Frontend**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Deployment**: GKE Autopilot, Helm charts
- **Content**: GitOps-based markdown workflow

Every blog post is a markdown file committed to the repo. When I merge a PR, the site automatically updates. Simple, effective, and version-controlled.

## Let's Connect

I'm passionate about quality engineering and always interested in discussing:

- Testing strategies and automation frameworks
- Building quality-first engineering cultures
- Web scraping and data validation challenges
- Cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes deployments
